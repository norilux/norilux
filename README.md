### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a javascript developer with more than three years of experience.

My main technology stack is React and Vue. My experience covers working for several companies as a JS developer. There I got a lot of knowledge and skills, which I use now.

Every day I actively study and develop in the field of JS. In the future, I will add NodeJS to my technology stack and become a full-fledged full stack developer.

Also, if we talk about the frontend part, I want to work with 3D graphics using such cool libraries as ThreeJS and Pixi. Because modern sites no longer look like regular sites but like full-fledged programs.

We are also on the verge of developing virtual and augmented reality technologies. It will be very cool if I can join there as a full-fledged VR developer
